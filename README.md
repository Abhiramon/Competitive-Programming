# What is Competitive Programming?

Competitive Programming is a mindsport where participants try to program solutions to various mathematical and algorithmic problems while adhering to run-time and system memory constraints.

# What is this repository?

This repostiory contains my solutions to thousands of programming challenges from multiple online judges. The purpose of this repo is to serve as a backup of all my solutions, and at the same time serve as a resource for fellow competitive programmers who are searching the internet for clues or solutions to problems that they are stuck on.

I should mention that none of these solutions are written with respect to best Software Engineering practices. The programs are written the way they are so that solutions to problems in competitions can be submitted as fast as possible. In some cases the solutions have small comments describing what the code is doing.

This repostiory also features some good implementations for advanced data structures and algorithms like - persistent segment trees, implict treaps, heavy light decomposition, centroid decomposition, suffix automaton etc.

## Codeforces

Codeforces is one of the most active competitive programming communities on the internet. Each sub-directory in the Codeforces directory is named after a Codeforces round. The solution for each problem in the round is featured in its own folder, named after the problem code, usually a single uppercase alphabet.
